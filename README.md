# Burger

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. When the user clicks a button and devours the burger, it moves to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
